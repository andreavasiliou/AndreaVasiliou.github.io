  <h3>World Wide Inequality and some of its causes</h3>
  <h4><b>Where is the highest inequality and how do we explain it?</b></h4>
    
    <p>The inequality in the world is measured by the Gini coefficient. <br>
        When the Gini coefficient is 0 it represents complete equality but when it is 100 it represents complete inequality.<br>
        This was done, by taking the data for worldwide Gini coefficient from World bank. I used a json file which included the coordinates for each country in the world. <br>
        In the Colab notebook, I matched the countries’ names with the countries’ names in the JSON file and matched their corresponding coordinates. 
        </p>

        <p>The highest income inequality is in the Namibia, with score of 59.1.<br>
             The project will mainly focus on India, Brazil, Argentina, China, as the top developing countries, and United Kingdom, USA, and Germany as the top developed countries.<br>
Therefore, from the countries of interest, the greatest inequality is in Brazil (53.3) and USA with 41.5. 
            </p>

  <p class="h3"><span style="color: rgb(180, 46, 221); font-weight: 1000;font-size:20px;"></span>Therefore, in the project I am suggesting that the key factors that affect inequality,<br>
     are government expenditure on education (as part of the GDP), % of people attending the secondary education and population growth.</p>

<p class="h1"><span style="color: rgb(180, 46, 221); font-weight: 1000;font-size:20px;">Government expenditure on education (% of GDP)</p>

  <p class="h3"><span style="color: rgb(180, 46, 221); font-weight: 1000;font-size:20px;">The second graph was created using World Bank data.<br>
     I downloaded all of the data and manipulated it in Excel in order to get the years of interest (from 2013 to 2017). <br>
     I calculated the average of the % of government expenditure on education for each country. I observed that the highest expenditure is in Brazil (5.756%). <br>
     Throughout the years, it can be observed from the graph that Brazil is always above the other countries. Therefore, we can say that this factor might not have a big effect on inequality, given the fact that Brazil has one of the highest inequalities in the World.</span></p>

  <p class="h3"><span style="color: rgb(180, 46, 221); font-weight: 1000;font-size:20px;">Graph3, is the % of the population that attend secondary education.<br>
     This is another factor that affect inequality, because when people attend secondary education, it is reasonable to believe that they are going to receive higher wages than the rest of the people who do not<br>
    attend secondary education, resulting in higher inequality.<br>
This graph was made by obtaining data from the World Bank for one specific year-2017. The biggest % is present in the United Kingdom, which can be a reasonable factor as the United Kingdom only has a Gini coefficient of 33.2, which is low in comparison to the rest of the countries discussed.

  <p class="h3"><span style="color: rgb(180, 46, 221); font-weight: 1000;font-size:20px;"></span>Graph4, is a regression between wages and secondary education in general in the World. <br>
            The R2= 0.02. this means that only 2% of the variation in the wages in UK is explained by the % of secondary educational attainment.<br>
             I used notebook colab, python correlation to end up with this graph. </p>

I used population growths for Argentina, brazil, India and china through Fred. I chose each data separately by requesting an API, then a I made a loop in python collab to put it in 1 csv. Then I adapted layering technique in Vega lite to put all the data in 1 graph.
