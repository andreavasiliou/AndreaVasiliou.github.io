   <h2> <span style="color: rgb(141, 42, 255); font-weight: 700;">Where is the heighest inequality and how do we explain it?</span></h2>
    
   <p>The aim of this project is to observe how inequality differs in the world. I will be measuring inequality by the Gini coefficient and mention some<br>
    possible causes that affect inequality.<br>
When the Gini coefficient is 0 it represents complete equality but when it is 100<br>
it represents complete inequality.</p>

<p>This was done, by taking the data for worldwide Gini coefficient from World bank.<br>
    I used a json file which included the coordinates for each country in the world. <br>
    In the Colab notebook, I matched the countries’ names with the countries’ names <br>
    in the JSON file and matched their corresponding coordinates.</p>

    <p>The highest income inequality is in Namibia, with score of 59.1. <br>
         The project will mainly focus on India, Brazil, Argentina, China, <br>
         as the top developing countries, and United Kingdom, USA, and Germany <br>
         as the top developed countries.<br>
    Therefore, from the countries of interest, the greatest inequality is in Brazil (53.3) and USA with (41.5).

<!-- Government expenditure on education-Chart2-->
    <h3><span style="color: rgb(20, 7, 36); font-weight: 1000;">Government expenditure on education</span></h3>
    <p>Consequently, in the project I am suggesting that the key factors that affect inequality, are government expenditure on education (as part of the GDP),<br>
         % of people attending the secondary education and population growth. </p>
    <div class="chart" id="chart2">
        <script>
            var myChart2 ="Government expenditure on education-area.json";
            vegaEmbed('#chart2',myChart2);
           </script>
    </div>
</div>
<p>The second graph was created using World Bank data. <br>
    I downloaded all of the data and manipulated it in Excel in order to get the years of interest (from 2013 to 2017).<br>
     I calculated the average of the % of government expenditure on education for each country. I observed that the highest expenditure is in Brazil (5.756%). <br>
     Throughout the years, it can be observed from the graph that Brazil is always above the other countries. <br>
     Therefore, we can say that this factor might not have a big effect on inequality, given the fact that Brazil has one of the highest inequalities in the World.</p>

     <!--% of people attending secondary education-Chart3-->
     <h3><span style="color: rgb(9, 2, 17); font-weight: 1000;">% of people attending secondary education</span></h3>
     <p>Graph3, is the % of the population that attend secondary education.<br>
         This is another factor that affect inequality, because when people attend secondary education, <br>
         it is reasonable to believe that they are going to receive higher wages than the rest of the people who do not 
         <br> attend secondary education, resulting in higher inequality.</p>
<div class="chart" id="chart3">
    <script>
        var myChart3 ="Percentage of secondary education attainment.json";
        vegaEmbed('#chart3, myChart3');
</script>
</div>
</div>

<p>This graph was made by obtaining data from the World Bank for one specific year-2017.<br>
     The biggest % is present in the United Kingdom, which can be a reasonable factor as the United Kingdom only has a Gini coefficient of 33.2,<br>
      which is low in comparison to the rest of the countries discussed. </p>

<p class=title1> The calculated R1=0.02. <br>
    This means that only 2% of the variation in wages is explained by educational attainment.</span></p>

<!--Regression between wages and educational attainment-Chart4-->
<h3><span style="color: rgb(9, 1, 17); font-weight: 700;">Regression between wages and educational attainment</span</h3>
<p>Graph4, is a regression between wages and secondary education in general in the World. <br>
    The R2= 0.02. this means that only 2% of the variation in the wages in UK is explained by the % of secondary educational attainment. <br>
    I used notebook colab, python correlation to end up with this graph. </p>

<!-- Population growth in 4 developing countries-Chart5-->
<h3><span style="color: rgb(14, 3, 27); font-weight: 700;">Population growth in 4 developing countries</span></h3>
<p>Graph5: Another factor that I think explains inequality is the population growth.
    <br>I used population growths for Argentina, brazil, India and china through Fred. 
    <br>I chose each data separately by requesting an API, then a I made a loop in python collab to put it in 1 csv. <br>
    Then I adapted layering technique in Vega lite to put all the data in 1 graph.
