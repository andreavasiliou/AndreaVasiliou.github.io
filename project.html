           <p>The aim of this project is to observe how inequality differs in the world. I will be measuring inequality by the Gini coefficient and mention some
            possible causes that affect inequality.When the Gini coefficient is 0 it represents complete equality but when it is 100 
            it represents complete inequality.</p>

            <p>This interactive map was done, by taking the data for worldwide Gini coefficient from World bank.
                I used a json file which included the coordinates for each country in the world.
                In the Colab notebook, I matched the countries’ names with the countries’ names 
                in the JSON file and matched their corresponding coordinates.</p>
         
    <p>The colab notebook is found here <a class="textLink"

    </p>
            <p>The highest income inequality is in Namibia, with score of 59.1.
                The project will mainly focus on India, Brazil, Argentina, China,
                as the top developing countries, and United Kingdom, USA, and Germany 
                as the top developed countries.Therefore, from the countries of interest, the greatest inequality for developing and developed countries is in Brazil (53.3)
                and USA(41.5), respectively.</p>
           <p>Consequently, in the project I am suggesting that the key factors that affect inequality, are
               government expenditure on education(as part of GDP),% of people attending the secondary education, gender wage gap
               and population growth.</p>

        <p>This graph was created using World Bank data.I downloaded all of the data and manipulated it in Excel in order to get 
            the years of interest (from 2013 to 2017).I calculated the average of the % of government expenditure on education for each country. 
            I observed that the highest expenditure is in Brazil (5.756%).Throughout the years, it can be observed from the graph that, Brazil is always above the other countries. 
             Therefore, we can say that this factor might not have a big effect on inequality, given the fact that Brazil has one of the highest inequalities in the World.</p>

        <p>I chose this as a possible factor that affects inequality since, low levels of expenditure on education and skills 
              limits peoples' ability to access decent jobs to develop themselves and participate fully in society, increasing 
        inequality levels.</p>

    <p>This graph demonstrates another factor affecting inequality.This is because, when people attending secondary education
        have a higher possibility for higher wages than the rest of the people who do not attend secondary education 
        resulting in higher inequality.</p>
      <p>This interactive bar chart was made using World Bank data. The data has been manipulated in Excel, in order to include only the countries
      of interest.This factor is connected to the next graph, as I wanted to observe whether wages and secondary education are correlated. This 
          was done because it is reasonable to believe that higher secondary education, leads to higher wages for those that attend this type 
          of education, leading to higher inequality.</p>

                <p>This graph is a regression between wages and secondary education in general in the World. 
                    The calculated R2= 0.02 suggests that, only 2% of the variation in the wages in the UK is explained
                    by the % of secondary educational attainment. 
                    This further suggests that there are other factors that can affect wages and as a result affect income
                    inequality. For example, gender wage gap and population growths.
                    For this graph, I used notebook colab, python correlation.</p>

                <p> I used population growths for Argentina, India, Brazil and China through Fred. 
                    I chose each data separately by requesting an API from FRED, then a I made a loop in python collab to put it in 1 csv.
                    Then I adapted layering technique in Vega lite to put all the data in 1 graph.
                    As suggested by the graph, the population growths for almost all countries are 
                    increasing at a decreasing rate. We can obviously observe that India is always above all countries.
                    Therefore, is the higher population growth a good factor explaining the income INEQUALITY?
                    Using the World map, India has in fact the lowest income inequality compared to the rest of the countries in this graph.
                    Therefore, we can conclude that it is not the best factor which explains income inequality.</p>

<h3><span style="color: rgb(20, 7, 36); font-weight: 1000;">Conclusions and limitations</span></h3>
<div class="box">
    <div class="d">
      <p>Concluding on the above, we can certainty agree that there are numerous forms of inequality as well as numerous factors affecting it. A possible limitation is that there are factors that are not included in the project and must be observed with cautious, 
          in order to have a valid conclusion. There were not any major concerns with data scrapping, and handling.
           However, a challenge that I faced, was when I created the world map, I had to manually change the names in order to match the countries’ names and coordinates with the other JSON file, using Python in Google Colab. 
           Moreover, I had to drop some countries that did not have a Gini coefficient, for a better map.</p>
