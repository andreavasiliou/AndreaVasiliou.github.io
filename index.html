  <!--Chart 15-->
<h3>This is my 15th chart of money market interest rates - monthly data</h3>
<p>The data used is from Eurostat . This chart is made for proving a statement made at the "Talking Economics" conference carried out on November 2021. This is my 15th chart of the money market interest rates - monthly data.
 "The level of interest rates is too low during the pandemic, especially after the first lockdown", this statement was made by Jagjit Chadha and is is indeed true.
 
  This can be seen, by the dramatic decrease in the interest rate followed by the first lockdown on March 2020. From March2019 the interest was 0.73, but in March2021 
  experienced the lowest level at 0.05. The lockdown effect on March 2020, can be seen by the 0.30 drop in the interest rate in 1 year.
